# Homyra
Homyra is a full-stack web application that allows users to list, discover, and book properties for short- or long-term stays, inspired by Airbnb's user experience. It is built as a hands-on project to gain experience in modern frontend and backend web development, including user authentication, dynamic search, and CRUD operations.
